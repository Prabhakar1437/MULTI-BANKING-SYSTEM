# MULTI-BANKING-SYSTEM
This project “Multibank Supportive Account book” provides  us a simple interface for maintainance of bank condidates’ information. It can be used by Bank to maintain the records of customers easily.  Achieving this objective is difficult using a manual system as the  information is scattered, can be redundant and collecting relevant  information may be very time consuming. All these problems are  solved using this project. Throughout the project the focus has been on  presenting information in an easy and intelligible manner. The project  is very useful for those who want to know about voter Information  Management Systems and want to develop softwares/websites based on the same concept.
